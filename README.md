# PlayerLink-Unity
Unity Package for PlayerLink. Uses our [PlayerLink API](www.github.com/derangedsenators/playerlink) to provide an intuitive interface to develop multiplayer games in Unity

There isn't much development on this project at present as we are waiting for PlayerLink to reach Developer Preview State before working on this package. Watch this space!
